> **Internship Project** | **Frontend Development** | **React & Redux**

## 📖 Project Overview
**Webby** is a modern **Price Comparison & Digital Marketplace** application developed during my internship at **Least Action Company**. It is designed to bridge the gap between digital assets (websites, templates) and physical products (electronics, fashion), introducing a unique **"Rent vs. Buy"** model.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building scalable **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** with **React**, managing complex global state with **Redux Toolkit**, and implementing responsive, high-quality user interfaces.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛒 Advanced Shopping Experience
- **Smart Price Comparison**: Intuitive interface for users to compare product prices and features.
- **Rent vs. Buy Logic**: A hybrid ownership model allowing users to choose between one-time purchases or subscription-based renting for digital assets.
- **Dynamic Cart System**: Fully functional cart with real-time state updates (Add, Remove, Adjust Quantity) powered by **Redux**.

### 📱 Digital & Physical Marketplace
- **Digital Storefront**: Dedicated section for websites, templates, and software solutions.
- **Physical Goods**: Browsing categories for Electronics, Fashion, and Beauty.
- **Category Filtering**: Seamless navigation across diverse product types.

### 🎨 UI/UX Excellence
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first architecture ensuring a flawless experience on all devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Engaging user experience with hover effects, smooth transitions, and toast notifications.
- **Seller Dashboard**: Admin interface for managing listings and tracking product performance.
